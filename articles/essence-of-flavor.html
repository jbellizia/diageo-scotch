                Flavor in a Scotch cocktail is about intention, not excess. From a twist of citrus to a whisper of peat, every element
                in a well-composed serve works in balance to elevate what’s already there. These aren’t drinks designed to mask or
                modify; they’re built to amplify.

            <h2>Flavor by Design</h2>
            <p>
                Great Scotch cocktails are layered with care—they’re tuned like fine instruments. A barspoon of amaro adds bittersweet
                tension. A few drops of saline accentuate the flavor. Pineapple, coconut, and even green tea have emerged as unexpected
                but intuitive partners. “Scotch is a layering agent,” says Ashley Steakly of J.S. Barnett’s in Waco, Texas. “It doesn’t
                have to dominate. It just has to speak.”
            </p>

            <h2>Beyond the Garnish</h2>
            <p>
                Orange or lemon peel still plays its part by brightening the nose and sharpening the palate, but it’s not alone.
                Bartenders are turning to new flavor cues: herbal liqueurs that echo grassy malts, a splash of ginger for structure, or
                just a touch of honey to round out smoke and spice. “Scotch already has depth,” says Christian Paolini of Fountain Inn
                in D.C. “You don’t need much—just the right accent.”
            </p>
            <section class="quote subsection">
                <p class="block-quote">
                    “Whether you flame it or not, expressing an orange peel over Scotch or a Scotch cocktail releases aromatic oils that
                    elevate the experience. It’s a simple move that adds bright, inviting fragrance and a touch of ceremony, turning any
                    pour into something more thoughtful and engaging.”

            <h2>The Sparkle Factor</h2>
            <p>
                Bubbles matter. Whether it’s club soda, tonic, or ginger ale, the right carbonation brings Scotch to life. “Highly
                carbonated soda and a freezing glass—that’s the real secret to a proper Highball,” says Roy Clark of Haberdasher,
                Mobile, Ala. The bubbles don’t just lift the drink—they stretch it, giving space for nuance to emerge.

            <h2>The Minimalist's Cocktail</h2>
            <p>
                When the goal is harmony, even the smallest additions can shift the frame. Citrus oils, microgreens, herbal tinctures,
                edible flowers, chilled dilution, and textural bubbles—all of it adds up to a drink that respects the whisky at its
                core. This is balance without clutter, depth without weight, Scotch still leading.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Accents with Intention</h2>
            
            <p>
                More than just decoration, garnish is flavor by design. Citrus in all its forms—peels, wheels, or a fresh
                squeeze—brightens the serve. Pineapple and herbs add freshness. Cinnamon or cherries deepen the frame. Each choice is
                purposeful, built to complement Scotch’s complexity without crowding it. On this tray, every element is an invitation to
                elevate the serve: subtle, balanced, and thoughtfully crafted.
