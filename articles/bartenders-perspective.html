        <h1>BARTENDER'S PERSPECTIVE</h1>
        <h4>How Top Bartenders Are Elevating Scotch Behind the Bar</h4>

            <h2>Rethinking the Ritual</h2>
            <p>
                Scotch has long held a revered place on the backbar&mdash;but today's bartenders aren't just pouring it neat. They're crafting cocktails that respect the whisky's structure while inviting new drinkers in. “You don't need to reinvent Scotch,” says Christian Paolini of The Fountain Inn, Washington, D.C., “You just need to listen to it&mdash;then build around what's already there.”

        <section>
            <h2>Less Is More</h2>
            <p>This new generation of Scotch cocktails is restrained, not ornamental. Erick Castro of Raised by Wolves, San Francisco puts it simply: “With Scotch, less does more. You're not hiding the spirit&mdash; you're letting it show off.” The best serves highlight its core character: citrus for lift, vermouth for polish, or just the clean contrast of soda water over long ice.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Precision Over Performance</h2>
            <p>For Liz Kelly of CURE, New Orleans, great Scotch cocktails are about precision. “The margin for error is smaller with Scotch,” she says. “It's bold, it's expressive&mdash; you need to work with it, not over it.” That means careful control over how much the drink is diluted, thoughtful use of garnishes, and a clear understanding of how every ingredient can either soften or highlight the whisky's character.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Letting Flavor Lead</h2>
            <p>What unites them all is a respect for the whisky. “With Scotch, the structure is already there,” says Roy Clark of Haberdasher, Mobile, AL. “Our job is to highlight it&mdash; not to get in the way.”</p>

            <h2>A New Kind of Welcome</h2>
            <p>Scotch cocktails aren't replacing neat pours&mdash; they're opening new possibilities. They're for the curious drinker who might not order a dram, but will try a highball. Or for the traditionalist who finds that a split-base Rob Roy offers a familiar complexity in a fresh frame.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Intentionally Simple</h2>
            <p>The cocktails featured throughout this piece are not complicated recipes. They're elegant, Scotch-forward, and made to be enjoyed&mdash;at home, at the bar, or wherever whisky is poured with care.</p>
