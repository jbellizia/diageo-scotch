        <h1>Exploring Scotch's Depth</h1>
    </header>
    <main class="article">
        <p class="indent">Scotch has earned its place at the top—poured neat, perhaps with a single rock, quietly savored and never rushed. For many whisky lovers, that's the whole point: to appreciate the spirit as it was crafted, shaped by time, place, and the hands of those who made it. No garnish required.</p><p class="indent">But tradition doesn't mean limitation. A new generation of Scotch aficionados is discovering the spirit not just for what it has been, but for what it can become—when mixed with intention, stirred with respect, and served from a fresh point of view. The result isn't a reinvention, but a rediscovery: bold, structured cocktails that put Scotch front and center, without compromising its character.</p><p class="indent">Throughout this editorial feature, the cocktails are purposefully simple—Scotch-forward, elegant, and easy to make at home. Developed by some of America's top bartenders, they're built with everyday ingredients and designed to highlight each whisky's unique flavor profile. Whether it's a refreshing highball, a stirred-up serve, or a classic build on the rocks, every recipe reflects Scotch's versatility and style.</p><p class="indent">Whether you're a seasoned imbiber or a curious newcomer, there's depth here worth exploring—neat, on the rocks, or in a modern mixed serve that still respects the past.

        <h2>Prestigious Heritage</h2>
        <p>Every great bottle of Scotch carries with it a sense of place. From the windswept south coast of Islay to the fertile Speyside valleys, and rugged Highland glens, the spirit reflects the landscape, water, and time that shape it. Distillers don't just make whisky—they steward legacy. And for those who drink it, that legacy is part of the experience.</p>

        <h2>Scotch in Three Acts</h2>
        <h4>Neat</h4>
        <p>Neat is where it begins. It's the purest lens into what a distillery stands for—its copper pot stills, its oak casks, its dark, silent warehouses. Sipped slowly, it builds a vocabulary: fruit, malt, smoke, sweetness, structure. For those who love Scotch, this is both ritual and reference point. Everything else begins here.</p>
